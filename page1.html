    <h1> AI in Space</h1>

    <p>Artificial intelligence is used in space all the time from rovers to satellites. NASA send AI into space to get more information quicker and safer. Rovers on mars collect samples to send back to earth.

    <p>NASA wants to use AI to help fix spacecraft and also send it into deep space. If AI was sent into deep space it would be able to work on its own without the help of people on earth.
